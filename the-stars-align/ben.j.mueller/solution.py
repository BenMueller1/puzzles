# You can see these points of light floating in the distance, 
# and record their position in the sky and their velocity, the relative change in position per second (your puzzle input)


# position=<-3,  6> velocity=< 2, -1>

# Each line represents one point. Positions are given as <X, Y> pairs: X represents how far left (negative) or right (positive) the point appears, 
# while Y represents how far up (negative) or down (positive) the point appears.

# KEY: At 0 seconds, each point has the position given. Each second, each point's velocity is added to its position.
